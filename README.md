## Description of Work

- **Week 2**  
  **Language**: Python  
  Built a gradient descent model to predict Coronary Heart Disease.

- **Week 3**  
  **Language**: Python (PyTorch)  
  Built a model to categorize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

- **Week 4**  
  **Language**: Python (PyTorch, Torchvision)  
  Used a CNN model for binary image classification. The model was trained on the Cats vs. Dogs dataset.

- **CIFAR-10**  
  **Language**: Python (PyTorch, Torchvision)  
  Used a CNN model for multi-class classification to categorize images into one of the 10 categories in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
